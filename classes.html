									<h4>COM S 611 - Advanced Topics in Algorithms</h4>
									<p>Algorithms and lower bound results for concurrent objects and synchronization. Given the spread of multiprocessor architectures, it is important to understand how to make computing more efficient by exploiting parallelism. To do this, proper synchronization and communication is essential among the processors that are working together on a common task. These multiprocessors will communicate through shared memory. We will study formally the types of coordination that are needed when processors are taking steps concurrently. We will see that there are inherent limitations on parallelism of certain events. One way to make sure certain events do not overlap is to use a mutual exclusion lock. The negative of this is that it requires waiting; a processor will need to wait until another processor completes its steps. To counter this, we introduce the wait-free and lock-free models of computation. Wait-free algorithms make progress even if only one processor is taking steps. However, these are harder to reason about. This study will lead to both algorithms, as well as impossibility results and lower bounds.</p>

Included, and of much interest, are issues like privacy, learning, game theory and complexity as they relate to the main topics. Applied areas that meaningfully intersect the main topics, like software engineering, bioinformatics, social sciences, economics and others will be of interest and, depending on the interests of participants, may be discussed as well.</p>
