									<h4>COM S 610 - Description Logics for Knowledge Representation on Semantic Web<h4>
									<p>The main topics of this course/seminar relate to Description Logics (DLs). This is a family of knowledge representation languages used to build ontologies that model specific application domains. It is based on appropriately restricted fragments of first-order logic. Included, and of much interest, are issues like privacy, learning, game theory and complexity as they relate to the main topics. Applied areas that meaningfully intersect the main topics, like software engineering, bioinformatics, social sciences, economics and others will be of interest and, depending on the interests of participants, may be discussed as well.</p>
