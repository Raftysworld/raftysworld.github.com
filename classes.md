##### **STAT 500** Statistical Methods I *(Fall 2012)*
Analysis of data from designed experiments and observational studies. Randomization-based inference; inference on group means; nonparametric bootstrap; pairing/blocking and other uses of restricted randomization. Use of linear models to analyze data; least squares estimation; estimability; sampling distributions of estimators; general linear tests; inference for parameters and contrasts. Model assessment and diagnostics; remedial measures; alternative approaches based on ranks.

##### **STAT 542** Theory of Probability and Statistics I *(Fall 2012)*
Sample spaces, basic probability results, conditional probability. Random variables, univariate distributions, moment generating functions. Joint distributions, conditional distributions and independence, correlation and covariance. Probability laws and transformations. Introduction to the multivariate normal distribution. Sampling distributions, normal theory, sums and order statistics. Convergence concepts, the law of large numbers, the central limit theorem and delta method. Basics of stochastic simulation.

##### **STAT 579** An Introduction to R *(Fall 2012)*
An introduction to the logic of programming, numerical algorithms, and graphics. The R statistical programming environment will be used to demonstrate how data can be stored, manipulated, plotted, and analyzed using both built-in functions and user extensions. Concepts of modularization, looping, vectorization, conditional execution, and function construction will be emphasized.

##### **STAT 503** Exploratory Methods and Data Mining *(Spring 2013)*
Approaches to finding the unexpected in data: data mining, pattern recognition and gaining understanding. Emphasis is on data-centered, non-inferential statistics, for large or high-dimensional data, and topical problems. Simple graphical methods, as well as classical and computer-intensive methods applied in an exploratory manner, and presentation graphics.

##### **STAT 512** Design of Experiments *(Fall 2013)*
