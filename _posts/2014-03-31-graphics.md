(This is a blog post made for the ninth reading assignment in STAT 585X.)

In the article Elements of a Viewing Pipeline, by Buja et. al, data analysis techniques based on real-time graphics are presented. The techniques and operations are organized into what is called a viewing pipeline.

First, Buja explains some reasons why one would prefer motion graphics to static graphics, including the smooth transitions and speed of moving points allowing the conveying of additional information. The viewing pipeline is then described - There must be some kind of mapping between the window to the viewport in order to view the two variables selected. Parallel Projections are supported as well. The windows will show a certain set of information conveying both the data and the operations that are being conducted. Variables are activated and de-activated with mouse clicks.

Viewport transformations are supported as well, allowing things such as expanding the data horizontally and vertically, or shifting it.

There are also some statistical inference methods, which allow things such as testing the indepdence of two variables by permuting one and holding the other fixed. If the plots look similar, they are likely independent. These techniques can be applied to alternate datasets, such as performing a tour on a dataset where some of the variables have permuted values.
