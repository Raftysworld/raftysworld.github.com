(This is a blog post made for the sixth reading assignment in STAT 585X.)

This article begins by discussing some of the history of data analysis, and how it was revolutionized by the creation of the S language at Bell Labs. Prior to S, data analysis was not visual or interactive. Instead, Fortran subroutines had to be called manually. This was not a good fit because statisticians in general were not programmers. Further, limited computer memory hindered the ability to analyze larger datasets.

These limitations ultimately motivated the creation of the S language, which included high level abstracted functions for doing regression, smoothing, and other forms of statistical analysis. However, the cost of S prevented its popularity from becoming more widespread, which led to the creation of R by two University of Auckland professors. R was essentially a from-scratch rewrite of the S language, keeping a similar grammar and syntax.

R quickly became popular because its open-source nature made it easily extensible. This allowed R to draw from a much larger group of developers all over the world. R packages are the embodiment of this differentiation from S. Packages, which bundle sets of functions, have extended the functionality of R immensely, and more are created every day. RCloud is another innovation that is currently being developed, which allows the workspace, and content (termed a Notebook) to be accessible from people via only a web-browser.

Ultimately, the S language and open-source R ushered in a new era of capabilities for data analysis.
