I've created a new site and blog based on HTML5/Twitter Bootstrap/Jekyll.  Still learning, but I do love the code highlighting that is included!

{% highlight r %}
# NOTE: Commenting out the old code to parse the website since the WEBSITE IS DOWN

getDate <- function(x) {
    return(strsplit(as.character(x), split = "-")[[1]][2])
}
{% endhighlight %}
