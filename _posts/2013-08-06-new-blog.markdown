I've created a new site and blog based on HTML5/Twitter Bootstrap/Jekyll.  Still learning, but I do love the code highlighting that is included!

You'll find this post in your `_posts` directory - edit this post and re-build (or run with the `-w` switch) to see your changes!
To add new posts, simply add a file in the `_posts` directory that follows the convention: YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight r %}
# NOTE: Commenting out the old code to parse the website since the WEBSITE IS DOWN

getDate <- function(x) {
    return(strsplit(as.character(x), split = "-")[[1]][2])
}
{% endhighlight %}
