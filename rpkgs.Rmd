## Why packages?

- Easy to install compared to sourcing in R scripts
- Dependency tracking (e.g., dplyr requires magrittr for the pipe operator, etc.)
- Package versioning
- Documentation is much easier
- Sharing with others via CRAN, GitHub

## Requirements

1. Relatively recent R/RStudio
2. devtools (`install.packages("devtools")`)
3. roxygen2 (`install.packages("roxygen2")`)

Some other potentially useful packages include:

- testthat (`install.packages("testthat")`) - Allows the writing of unit tests for individual functions
- knitr (`install.packages("knitr")`) and rmarkdown (`install.packages("rmarkdown")`) for building Vignettes

## C Code Compilation

Andee will cover this next week, but if you want to get a jump on installing some necessary software for including C code in your packages:

    If you’re developing a package that uses binary code (e.g. C or C++)
    you’ll also need a set of development tools. On Windows, download 
    and install Rtools, and devtools takes care of the rest. On Mac, 
    install the Xcode command line tools. On Linux, install the R 
    development package, usually called r-devel or r-base-dev.

## Are we Ready?

We can check:

```{r}
library(devtools)

has_devel()
```

## Creating a Package in RStudio

```{r, echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("img/project.png")
```

## Naming your Package

From http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/package.html:

- Pick a unique name you can easily Google.
- Avoid using both upper and lower case letters
- Find a word that evokes the problem and modify it so that it’s unique:
    - plyr is generalisation of the apply family, and evokes pliers.
    - lubridate makes dates and times easier.
- Add an r to the end of a word
