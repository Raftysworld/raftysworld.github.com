### Courses TAed at Iowa State University

##### **STAT 305** Engineering Statistics *(Fall 2012)*
Statistics for engineering problem solving. Principles of engineering data collection; descriptive statistics; elementary probability distributions; principles of experimentation; confidence intervals and significance tests; one-, two-, and multi-sample studies; regression analysis; use of statistical software; team project involving engineering experimentation and data analysis.

##### **STAT 430** Empirical Methods for the Computational Sciences *(Fall 2012)*
Statistical methods for research involving computers; exploratory data analysis; selected topics from analysis of designed experiments - analysis of variance, hypothesis testing, interaction among variables; linear regression, logistic regression, Poisson regression; parameter estimation, prediction, confidence regions, dimension reduction techniques, model diagnostics and sensitivity analysis; Markov chains and processes; simulation techniques and bootstrap methods; applications to computer science, bioinformatics, computer engineering - programs, models and systems as objects of empirical study; communicating results of empirical studies. Statistical software: R.

##### **STAT 579** An Introduction to R *(Fall 2013)*
An introduction to the logic of programming, numerical algorithms, and graphics. The R statistical programming environment will be used to demonstrate how data can be stored, manipulated, plotted, and analyzed using both built-in functions and user extensions. Concepts of modularization, looping, vectorization, conditional execution, and function construction will be emphasized.

##### **STAT 480** Statistical Computing Applications *(Spring 2014)*
Modern statistical computing. Data management; spread sheets, verifying data accuracy, transferring data between software packages. Data and graphical analysis with statistical software packages. Algorithmic programming concepts and applications. Simulation. Software reliability.
